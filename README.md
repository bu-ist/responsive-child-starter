# [Project Name]

A starter template for child themes of the Responsive Framework.

CREATIVE DIRECTOR: Please provide a brief description here, then fill out links below
and set up a new [Github Project](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-child-starter/wiki/Setting-up-Github-Projects).

## Quick Start

- [Set up a new custom theme](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-child-starter/wiki/Setting-up-new-custom-themes)
- Install your [development dependencies](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-child-starter/wiki/Install-development-dependencies)
- Run  `npm install`, then `grunt` to begin watching changes.
- Upload to [your sandbox](http://sites.bu.edu/marcom-team/departments/interactive-design/interactive-design-workflow/development/sandboxes-overview/) to see changes.

## Common commands this theme supports

- `npm install`: Install your development dependencies
- `grunt`: Watch your theme for changes and compile when a change is detected.
- `grunt build`: Manually build all theme assets.
- `grunt version`: [Force CSS and JavaScript to refresh when you deploy changes](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-child-starter/wiki/Versioning).

## Setting up Documentation site

It is best to create the documentation site right out of the gate. This way documentation of features can happen through out the project instead of piling up at the end.
- Clone http://wpdocs.bu.edu/ to http://wpdocs.bu.edu/yoursitename
- Apply your theme 
- Edit/cut anything existing that doesn’t apply to your custom theme
- Add new pages for custom functionality as needed.
Check out [Dining Documentation](http://wpdocs.bu.edu/dining/) for an awesome example!
