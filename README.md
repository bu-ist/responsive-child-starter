## Setting up Documentation site

It is best to create the documentation site right out of the gate. This way documentation of features can happen through out the project instead of piling up at the end.
- Clone http://wpdocs.bu.edu/ to http://wpdocs.bu.edu/yoursitename
- Apply your theme 
- Edit/cut anything existing that doesnâ€™t apply to your custom theme
- Add new pages for custom functionality as needed.
Check out [Dining Documentation](http://wpdocs.bu.edu/dining/) for an awesome example!
